Technical synopsis:  A user is able to click on their favorite character and see related information.   When information is unavailable, an appropriate error message is displayed. The application is built using react.js. No other external libraries are used except for Bootstrap. I choose not to use Redux, because I felt it was unnecessary for this project, accordingly all state is local. The application component provides functionality and state to the rest of the application.  Each element of the application is separated into its own component. 

To setup: 

1. Npm Install 
2. Npm Start
